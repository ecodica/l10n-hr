If the setting 'Enable Tips' is set to 'True', and the invoice is an outgoing (customer) invoice, a new page appears on the form view, where the user can enter the Tip Amount and Tip Payment Method.

The Tips Report is available through Invoicing / Reporting / Management / Tips Report. A wizard pops up with 3 input fields: Date From and Date To (which are mandatory) and Employee (employee from the invoice). If employee is not selected, report is generated for all employees.
