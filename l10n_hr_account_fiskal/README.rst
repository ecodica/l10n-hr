Obtain client certificates from FINA
====================================

Which certificates you need depends on whether you're developing and testing
integration (a "DEMO certificate"), or need it to go live and connect to
the service in production ("production certificate").

Production certificate can't be used for integration testing, so if you're
doing everything in-house (developing for own use and need to test the
integration), you'll need to sign up for both DEMO and production cert.

The certificates must be obtained from [FINA](https://www.fina.hr/fiskalizacija).

1. DEMO certificates

    Fill in the request form
    [Zahtjev za izdavanje Demo certifikata za fiskalizaciju](https://www.fina.hr/documents/52450/155573/7+Zahtjev+za+RDC_fiskalizacija+-+Demo_06092018.pdf/8c70682a-bd32-c32f-84f0-ce0441dba8ca)
    (PDF). You can send the request form  via email (alongside scans of your
    identity card), or file the request in person at any FINA office.

    The DEMO certificate is free.

2. Production certificates

    If you haven't already, you'll first need to register your company in FINA's
    PKI database. This will cost you about €10 (one-time fee) and you'll need to show
    [a few company registration documents](https://www.fina.hr/fiskalizacija#kako-do-certifikata).

    You'll also need to fill in
    [Zahtjev za izdavanje produkcijskog certifikata za fiskalizaciju](https://www.fina.hr/documents/52450/155573/ZahtjevCertFiskal.pdf/5a1b5509-378c-fb1f-ff7e-c95091dd2863?t=1600774713433) (one copy) and
    [Ugovor o obavljanju usluga certificiranja](https://rdc.fina.hr/obrasci/RDC-ugovor1.pdf)
    (two copies).

    The production certificate costs around €40 and is valid for 5 years.
