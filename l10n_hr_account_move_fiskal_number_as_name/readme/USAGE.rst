When the invoice is confirmed, it will have the same number as Fiskal Number. If Fiskal Number is not set for account move, then the default sequence will be used.
If Fiskal Name is set, then it must be the same as the Name, otherwise, a validation error will be raised.
Fiskal Number field is moved into Croatia Fiskal Data (we don't need to show the same number twice on the invoice header)
